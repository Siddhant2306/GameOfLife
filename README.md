## The Four Rules of Conwayâ€™s Game of Life

These rules are applied to every cell in the grid for the next generation:

1. **Underpopulation**  
   Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies.

2. **Survival**  
   Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.

3. **Overpopulation**  
   Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies.

4. **Reproduction**  
   Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
